# SE-STORE Program Development (PSP 0 & PSP 0.1)

This repository highlights the development of the **SE-STORE** project, created using the **Personal Software Process (PSP) methodology**, specifically PSP 0 and PSP 0.1. It showcases progressive iterations of a store management system implemented in Java, accompanied by detailed PSP logs and analysis.

---

## Project Overview

The **SE-STORE** project consists of 10 iterative programs, progressing from basic functionality to a full-featured store management system. Each iteration follows the PSP framework, focusing on time tracking, defect management, and continuous improvement.

### Key Features Across Iterations
1. **SE-STORE#1**: Basic product listing.
2. **SE-STORE#2**: Product categorization.
3. **SE-STORE#3**: Currency conversion to THB.
4. **SE-STORE#4**: User authentication and role-based access.
5. **SE-STORE#5**: Member role management.
6. **SE-STORE#6**: Sorting and discounts by role.
7. **SE-STORE#7**: Editing member information.
8. **SE-STORE#8**: Staff-based product management.
9. **SE-STORE#9**: Shopping cart and order management.
10. **SE-STORE#10**: Search and advanced order handling.

## PSP Methodology Implementation

### PSP 0: **Baseline Process**
- **Focus**: 
  - Time tracking.
  - Basic defect recording.
  - Individual responsibility for planning and development.

### PSP 0.1: **Enhanced Process**
- **Focus**: 
  - Incorporating defect prevention and detailed tracking.
  - Iterative improvement in design and code quality.

## PSP Highlights

- **Time Tracking**:
  - All programs include planned vs. actual time reports.
  - Analysis of time deviations to identify bottlenecks.

- **Defect Recording**:
  - Logs highlight defect counts and resolution time.
  - No compile-time or test-phase defects detected across all programs.

- **Design & Workflow Improvements**:
  - Flowcharts for each iteration to ensure clarity and modularity.
  - Increased efficiency in later iterations due to familiarity with PSP practices.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- **Personal Software Process (PSP)**:
  - Mastered foundational PSP practices (PSP 0, PSP 0.1).
  - Applied structured problem-solving techniques.
  
- **Java Development**:
  - Progressed from basic programming to advanced features.

- **Process Improvement**:
  - Identified key areas for enhancement through iterative feedback.

## Documentation

Each iteration includes:
- **Development Plan**: Goals and methodology for each version.
- **Time Recording Logs**: Planned vs. actual time analysis.
- **Defect Recording Logs**: Issue tracking and resolution.
- **Flowcharts**: Workflow representation.
